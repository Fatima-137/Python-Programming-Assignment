    "    Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming  in which programmers define the data type of a data structure and also the types of operations that can be applied to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another."
